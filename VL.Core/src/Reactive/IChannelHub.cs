    /*
     * Channels & Bindings:
     * The user shall be able to edit global channels manually in an editor extension window.
     * It shall be possible to remove channels, even if some come with a couple of bindings. Those should get deleted as well.
     *     Bindings could get stored as components attached to a channel.
     *     A Redis app component would only store which channels to sync (their names e.g. via a regular expression query and look 
     *     up the Redis bindings in the found channels in the ChannelHub).
     * 
     * Entry points:
     * A user wants to think per entry point. 
     * Reasoning: 
     *     Opening help patches shall not mess up your project entry point; 
     *     After closing a patch the dev session should be as clean as possible..
     * Per entry point we have one channel hub that represents all global channels for the app. 
     * There still could be a way to opt-into a global channel behavior that binds channels of different entry points:
     *     a certain app component that bridges one entry-point with the other (merges their ChannelHubs on localhost).
     * 
     * IDE & imperative API:
     * Editor extension windows (for editing global channels and their bindings) show the global channels
     * for one entry point - which could be synced to what patch we currently look at. There could be different
     * such windows that all want to help the user from different angels (MIDI specific view, overview over 
     * all channels and their bindings...). 
     *     In order to implement those windows the channel hub has an imperative way to add and remove or modify channels. 
     * 
     * Descriptive API:
     * An alternative design is to have channel description providers, which can register and tell of their needs via
     * something like a IObservable<IEnumerable<ChannelDescription>>. The distinct, merged needs of all channel 
     * providers would determine which channels exist. This could be added later. 
     *     All those channels could be locked; they wouldn't be editable by the user, since those are needed by some app component.
     *     When adding an IOBoxSyncAppComponent this could be thought of as a collection of channeldescriptions, resulting in locked channels
     * 
     * vvvv Editor ChannelHub:
     * The vvvv editor runtime can be seen as yet another app, which comes with its own channels hub.
     * A boygroup app component e.g. would be part of the vvvv IDE, which shall work even when in paused or stopped mode.
     * Such a boygrouping app component would setup a Redis binding for some central channels inside the editor channel hub.
     *     A channel Boygrouping/DocDiffs is not visible to the user as it is part of the IDE channelhub, not an entry-point channelhub.
     * 
     * Usage & Storage:
     * For the user app the user shall place a GlobalChannels node somewhere. 
     * That's the place where to store the channel descriptions in a pin. 
     * This way we don't need to invent config files or hidden areas in a vl document to store those settings. 
     * The user is boss where to place this central node and how to reference the file in question.
     * Ideally the patcher would only get access to the global channels when there is a reference to the document that 
     * has setup those channels. 
     * 
     * Accessing channels:
     * Access to channels can be granted by statically typed nodes - named after the channel - and by dynamic lookups.
     * Whenever the ChannelHub for an entry point changed its entries new nodes get built by a factory accordingly. 
     * BeginChange can be used to group changes in bulks, so that the event OnChannelsChanged triggers less often.
     * The ChannelHub implementation takes care of creating the nodes.
     * 
     * Implementation:
     * The GlobalChannels node would aquire the IChannelHub app component per app via IAppHost.GetComponent;
     * And then take control over it, representing the single source of truth for the channels for this app.
     * App Components (e.g. Redis) are managed by the apphost. It disposes all app components on Stop.
     * They can and should make use of this moment and leave a clean state. E.g. remove certain channels from a Redis database.
