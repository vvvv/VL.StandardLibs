    // * where to implement (e.g. in a ui library) vl.ui.forms
    // * and in the way we design the hopefully accessible and easy to use api
    // it might also need to get moved to VL.Core at some point, but for now this doesn't make
    // too much sense. Also in the interface you need access to the one or other type that currently
    // resides in VL.Lang.
    // maybe at some point it's not so much about moving everything to VL.Core and doing the abstraction
    // there. we could do the same by moving some concrete implementations outof VL.Lang and only keep
    // basic astractions inside VL.Lang.
