## Using the library
Recent vvvv versions (>= 2021.4) have this package pre-installed. Simply open the node browser and select the `VL.Video.MediaFoundation` package.

For earlier versions of vvvv the package has to be [installed manually](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) by opening the command line and typing:

    nuget install VL.Video.MediaFoundation -version 0.0.9-alpha

Once the VL.Video.MediaFoundation nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll see the category "MediaFoundation" under "Video" in the nodebrowser. 

Demos are available via the Help Browser!
